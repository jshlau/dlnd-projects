# Udacity Nanodegree Projects

These are the Jupyter Notebooks I submitted as projects during the course of Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree program.

## Files/Jupyter Notebook Details

dlnd_tv_script_generation - Use of a RNN to generate a (very non-sensical) TV script. This will most likely be modified in the future to take into account suggestions from the reviewer.

dlnd_face_generation - Involves the use of a generative adversarial network and tested on the MNIST and CelebA databases.
